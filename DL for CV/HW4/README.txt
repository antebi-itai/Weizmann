Instructions
------------
  1. Copy the files from homework 2 and 3 and rename them accordingly (see above).
  2. Open your Google Drive in the browser.
  3. Create a directory called "DL4CV" in your Google Drive.
  4. In "DL4CV", create a sub-directory called "hw4".
  5. Upload ALL the files listed above to "hw4" under "DL4CV".
  6. Double-click on "RNN.ipynb" to open it in Google Colab.
  7. Follow the instructions in the notebook and solve the coding assignment.
  8. Double-click on "styletransfer/main.ipynb" to open it in Google Colab.
  9. Follow the instructions in the notebook and solve the style-transfer coding assignment.
  10. Run the last cell in the notebook to create a submission zip file and download it.
  11. Upload your submission zip to the assignment's submission box (a Dropbox linked; sent in Piazza).
